# Checkers Game - using OOP .NET WinForms


## Overview

This is a Checkers game built using .NET WinForms and designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project is divided into two main components:

### • **Backend (CheckersLogic)**: Handles the game logic, rules, and board management.  
### • **Frontend (GameUI)**: Manages the user interface, including the game board, player interactions, and settings.

Despite the simplicity of the classic Checkers game, we built a hands-down project from scratch. Every class was designed accordingly and properly separated, ensuring a clean OOP architecture that’s easy to maintain and extend
