## Overview

This is a Checkers game built using .NET WinForms and designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

The project is divided into two main components:

### • **Backend (CheckersLogic)**: Handles the game logic, rules, and board management
### • **Frontend (GameUI)**: Manages the user interface, including the game board, player interactions, and settings.

## Features
### • **Play Against Computer**: Challenge a simple AI opponent for single-player mode.
### • **Two-Player Checkers**: Play against another player on the same machine.
### • **Game Rules Enforcement**: The backend ensures all moves follow standard Checkers rules.
### • **Dynamic UI**: The frontend provides an interactive and responsive game board.
### • **Settings**: The players can each choose their name and icon to represent them.

Game can be played against a **computer**, or against your friend.
Despite the simplicity of the classic Checkers game, we built a hands-down project from scratch. Every class was designed accordingly and properly separated, ensuring a clean OOP architecture that’s easy to maintain and extend
